# CNV_detection
Background:
You are developing an NGS​-based assay for a recently characterized disorder called Deldupemia, an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the CNSL gene. Due to high sequence homology in the CNSL region, deletions and duplications are common (thus, rather than all patients having two copies of DNA across the region, some have one, and others have three). The deletion/duplication breakpoints can vary from sample to sample (see table further below), and it has been hypothesized that the breakpoints correspond with ethnicity.
With help from someone on the molecular biology team, you developed probes for the CNSL region and performed a retrospective analysis of 10,000 samples spanning different ethnicities. The data in “cnsl_data.csv.gz” catalogs the depth of NGS reads at 100 different hybrid capture probe locations, 50 in the CNSL region, and 50 outside of the region. The depth at a probe is expected to be linearly proportional to the copy number of the DNA at that site (i.e., having three CNSL copies should give roughly 3x the depth as having one copy).
